# PayMeBack
This is a way to calculate how much is owed between two parties.
This program  can be easily used by first converting a spreadsheet into a CSV file, so it can be easily read.
It organizes expenses based on the date occured, the amount borrowed, and the amount lent out.
Then it takes the net of each day, and uses it to come up with a total due and determines which party has  to pay money
